# fyg-iot
Our Project for Human Computer Interaction Course Semester 2 @Bina Nusantara Bandung

## Backstory
This is our first project on IoT on Course Human Computer Interaction. The name fyg is based on our member name (Fabian, Yoga and Girenda). 
At first we will using 9W LED Lamp with some Relay, but unlucky for us the power on the cafe get turned off by accidentaly because our wiring is not good :D. 
So we replace our lamp with some 5mm LED!
We promise we will back with some cool and good project in the future!

## What can this fyg-iot do?
We can turn off and turn on the lamp on the website (make sure your on the same wifi with the lamp).
We used photosensor to make the lamp on and off based on the lighting around the lamp.
